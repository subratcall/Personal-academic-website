Personal acadmic website with animations

So i made this website for my dad, and just wanna share it, in case of someone would like to create smth like this as well.
Its mobile responsive, scallable etc. Where pictures were i added "your-img" text so its easy to find them all:D
Also there is a website visit counter, if you want to use it you should interest in some free API for that and put your url in JS file, i have used countapi.xyz
Code is not that clear and pretty but im like beginner in this kind of stuff, so sorry for that.
